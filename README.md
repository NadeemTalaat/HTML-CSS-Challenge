# Horiseon Landing Page
## Description
This web app is a landing page for the brand Horiseon, a brand management firm, which considers accesibility standards, includes links to other aspects on the page, and uses basic HTML and CSS structuring.

Through this web app, I was able to learn more about semantic HTML structuring, CSS styling, and the accessibility standards present in the web development industry.
## Installation

Load index.html file to access landing page. CSS styling is external but linked within index.html page.

## Usage
This is mainly a site for information (reading) purposes, but the links at the top right of the page can be used to quickly access sections of the content of the page.
